# linear-regression-sklearn
In this repository I've mentioned the linear regression code by using the Sklearn library. For knowing the exact method implementation of linear regression by scratch you can refer to linear regression scratch repository.
All the codeline have been explained in the .py documents.
For input, I've used a csv file but you can use your own datas and costumize based on your need.
